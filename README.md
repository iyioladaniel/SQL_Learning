# SQL_Learning
This contains the codes I wrote while learning sequel using MySQL workbench.

There are different codes here actually.
Maven Movies database is created as part of the learning course of Maven Analytics SQL for Beginners course.

The different scripts I wrote while learning are all here and the different questions.

After this, I had a job interview which had to do with automating a contact tracing script.

Thank you. I will keep updating this as I learn and progress.
